If user accidentally drop the database.
Solution:
Case: No Admin exists yet
After dropping the database-
When you open /Account/CreateAdmin:

The code checks your Users table.

If no user with role = Admin is found ‚Üí it creates a default Admin account:

Email: admin@yourapp.com

Password: 123456 (‚ö†Ô∏è plain for now, but can be hashed)

You‚Äôll see the message:
‚úÖ Admin account created. Email: admin@yourapp.com, Password: 123456

At this point, you can log in with that account.
